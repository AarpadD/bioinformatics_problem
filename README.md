# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts the presence of heart disease using logistic regression and random forest classifiers. Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and predictions are performed in a step-by-step manner.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `heart.csv`, which contains patient information like age, sex, chest pain type, and more.

## Key Features
- **EDA**: Visualizations of feature distributions and correlations.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling categorical data and scaling numerical values.
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
- **Prediction**: Trained models to predict based on user input.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.12
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, joblib
